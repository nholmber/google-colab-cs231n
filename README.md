# Using Google Colaboratory for Jupyter Notebooks

This repository contains my so-far incomplete solutions to the first problem set on the [convolutional neural networks course CS231n arranged by Stanford University](https://cs231n.github.io). I have decided to adapt the original Jupyter notebooks to be compatible with [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb), which is a free cloud-based notebook environment with a GPU backend. You can find a short tutorial on how to use Google Colaboratory on my [blog](https://nholmber.github.io/2018/09/google-colab/). Alternatively, feel free to open up [this notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/nholmber/google-colab-cs231n/blob/master/assignment1/knn.ipynb) on Google Colaboratory, which is the notebook that I've used as a part of my tutorial.
